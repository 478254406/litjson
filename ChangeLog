2007-09-07  Leonardo Boshell  <leonardoboshell@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/LitJson/JsonMapper.cs:
	  Added base importers for loading int values into double and float
	  variables.
	* test/JsonMapperTest.cs:
	  Added test for new importers.

2007-09-06  Leonardo Boshell  <leonardoboshell@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/LitJson/JsonReader.cs:
	  Added EndOfInput property to JsonReader, with different semantics than
	  EndOFJson. This way, JsonReader can parse several pieces of JSON text
	  from the same input.
	* test/JsonReaderTest.cs:
	  Added test for the new behaviour of EndOfJson, and EndOfInput.

	* AUTHORS:
	* HACKING: Added short note about credits of contributions.

2007-08-15  Leonardo Boshell  <leonardoboshell@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/LitJson/JsonWriter.cs: Clear the stack instead of creating a new
	stack in Reset().

2007-08-15  Leonardo Boshell  <leonardoboshell@users.sourceforge.net>

	=== Release 0.3.0 ===

2007-08-14  Leonardo Boshell  <leonardoboshell@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/LitJson/JsonMapper.cs: Added Importers functionality, similar to
	the way exporters work.
	* test/JsonMapperTest.cs: Added tests for the importers.

2007-08-14  Leonardo Boshell  <leonardoboshell@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/LitJson/JsonWriter.cs: Added Write(ulong number) overload.

	* src/LitJson/JsonMapper.cs: Added Exporters functionality. Base
	exporters are implemented to convert basic Value types such as byte,
	char, DateTime, etc. to JSON. Custom exporters can be added through
	JsonMapper.RegisterExporter(). Also, ToJson() now throws an exception if
	a certain nesting limit is reached to avoid infinite loops.

	* test/JsonMapperTest.cs: Added new tests for the exporters feature.

2007-08-14  Leonardo Boshell  <leonardoboshell@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/LitJson/JsonWriter.cs: Added Reset() method to make it possible to
	re-use a JsonWriter instance.
	* src/LitJson/JsonMapper.cs: When performing the default ToJson()
	operation, use a static instance of JsonWriter, improving performance
	for multiple object->JSON conversions.
	* test/JsonMapperTest.cs: Added use of JsonWriter.Reset().

2007-08-14  Leonardo Boshell  <leonardoboshell@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/LitJson/JsonData.cs: Added public Count property. Fix int indexer
	logic to work both when it's an array and an object.
	* src/LitJson/JsonMapper.cs: Added two new methods, ToJson(object,
	JsonWriter) and ToObject(JsonReader), so the mapping can be customized
	through JsonWriter and JsonReader objects.
	* test/JsonMapperTest.cs: Added new tests for the new JsonMapper
	methods.

2007-08-13  Leonardo Boshell  <leonardoboshell@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/LitJson/JsonReader.cs:
	* src/LitJson/Lexer.cs: Extended the lexer to allow comments as well.
	* test/JsonReaderTest.cs: Added tests for reading JSON with comments on
	them.
	* doc/manual/sources/entities/urls.ent:
	* doc/manual/sources/appendices/parser/parser.xml: Added details about
	these recent extensions to the lexer in the manual.

2007-08-13  Leonardo Boshell  <leonardoboshell@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/LitJson/JsonReader.cs:
	* src/LitJson/Lexer.cs: Added property to indicate whether single-quoted
	strings are allowed or not. This parameter is true by default.
	* test/JsonReaderTest.cs: Added test for single-quoted strings.
	* doc/manual/sources/appendices/parser/parser.xml: Simplify lexer table
	and include the new behaviour regarding single-quoted strings.

2007-08-12  Leonardo Boshell  <leonardoboshell@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/LitJson/JsonWriter.cs: Renamed private method Check() to
	DoValidation().
	* src/LitJson/Lexer.cs: Whitespace cleanups. Renamed HasReachedEnd to
	EndOfInput.
	* test/JsonReaderTest.cs:
	* src/LitJson/JsonReader.cs: Renamed HasReachedEnd to EndOfJson.
	* test/Makefile.am: Added LitJson.dll as a dependency to the Tests
	assembly.

2007-08-11  Leonardo Boshell  <leonardoboshell@users.sourceforge.net>

	* inc-assembly.make:
	* src/LitJson/Makefile.am:
	Don't build the Tests assembly unless 'make check' is run.

2007-08-11  Leonardo Boshell  <leonardoboshell@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/LitJson/AssemblyInfo.cs.in: Added CLSCompliant attribute.
	* doc/manual/Makefile.am: Added rule to avoid breaking compilation if
	the support docbook files are not available.

<p>The API reference is being prepared. For now, it&#39;s recommended that
you get familiar with the library by reading the Quick Start guide
above, or if you feel like getting a deeper understanding of its
internal details, feel free to explore the source code. This is a
small library, so it shouldn&#39;t be too much effort, and you may find
examples covering most of its functionality in the test suites.</p>

little about this project&#39;s history, if that&#39;s okay. Feel free to
skip this, if you want.</p>

<p>I created LitJSON around August, 2007. As I remember it, I had
just recently learned C# (and was very enthusiastic about it), and
was looking for a simple mechanism to store data for my programs.
This led me to learning about JSON, a format that was not that
popular at the time.</p>

<p>I eventually took the time to write this parser, and then released
it publicly, hoping that maybe a few other people would find it
somewhat useful.  Apparently it did got some use, and I&#39;m very
pleased and grateful for having had the chance to contribute even
in a very small way to the current landscape of JSON libraries for
the .Net framework.</p>

<p>I had some vision of what I wanted to accomplish through software
in the grand scheme of things, and LitJSON was just a small piece
that in a way served as a starting point for me to get on the
track I was aiming for.  I had big plans, and was fully expecting
to maintain this little piece of software for a long time.</p>

<p>But, as you may know, the only predictable thing about life is
that it&#39;s unpredictable. Very soon afterwards (early 2008), my
life went through some important changes, and my focus shifted to
other things, not related to software. During all this time, I
have received a number of e&ndash;mails and patches from people wanting
to contribute to this library, and I thank them for that. However,
I completely neglected my maintainer duties, and I simply stashed
all those contributions away, hoping to get to them on a future
opportunity.</p>

<p>Well, time goes by pretty quickly; it&#39;s 2013 now, and as it turns
out, I never touched LitJSON again since late 2007. It&#39;s always
been in my &ldquo;to do&rdquo; list to get back to it and at least give it
some proper closure, but I just never did.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;ve been focusing on software again, and recently I got
contacted by someone who wanted to ask for my permission to
translate LitJSON&#39;s manual into spanish. That was as good as an
opportunity as any for me to finally work on LitJSON again, so
here I am. However, a number of things have changed drastically
during all this time. As it happens to everyone, I have changed,
and my interests, opinions and tastes have changed. In regards to
software and technology, a lot of the things I was enthusiastic
about in 2007 are not that exciting to me anymore. I don&#39;t mean to
imply that I dislike some of the technologies used in LitJSON, but
the reality is that if I were to work again on my original vision
from all those years ago, I would do a lot of things differently,
and that probably means I wouldn&#39;t work in something like LitJSON
today.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, here I am, ready to bring back some life into this
library.  My current plan is to do a couple of things: complete
the manual (I never published any docs for the API, which I think
was a terrible decision on my part), and merging the patches I
have collecting dust somewhere in my inbox.</p>

<p>For now, I&#39;ve started by moving this project from SourceForge to
GitHub. Thanks to <em>SF</em> for providing such high&ndash;quality service
for all these years, and I don&#39;t mean only for my silly little
library, but for all the Open&ndash;Source/Free Software projects they
host. It will take some time to fully transition everything, so
please bear with me if something doesn&#39;t work.  Let&#39;s hope this
doesn&#39;t take me another 6 years.</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by&hellip;</p>
